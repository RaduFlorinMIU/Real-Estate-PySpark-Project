# Real Estate Market Data Exploration in Toulouse and its Suburbs

## Project Context:
In this project, I undertook an in-depth exploration of the real estate market in proximity to Toulouse. The primary aim was to gain profound insights into the Toulouse and suburban real estate landscape. Leveraging a comprehensive 5-year dataset of houses and apartments sales transactions, encompassing diverse attributes such as sale date, location (city, postal code), residence type, sale type, land area, living area, number of rooms, and price, formed the cornerstone of this exploration.

## Project Objective:
The central objective of this project was to harness the power of Spark for robust data analysis, ensuring scalability for potential application to larger datasets spanning the entire real estate market in France. While Spark facilitated extensive data processing capabilities, Python visualization libraries, notably seaborn, were employed to present key findings effectively. Through this endeavor, the goal was to uncover nuanced insights pertaining to pricing trends, geographical disparities, property types, sales methodologies, and distinctions between urban and suburban locales.

## Key Features:
- Leveraged Spark for scalable data analysis, ensuring versatility for larger datasets.
- Explored a rich 5-year history of real estate transactions, encompassing diverse attributes.
- Employed Python visualization libraries to articulate key findings with clarity and precision.
- Deployed a machine learning model to predict property prices, enhancing the depth of analysis and providing a forward-looking perspective.
- Delivered actionable insights to inform strategic decision-making processes at Immo-Inv.

This project showcases my proficiency in conducting comprehensive data exploration and leveraging advanced techniques, including machine learning, to extract actionable insights in the realm of real estate analysis.
